# 🎯 FocusQuest

FocusQuest is a **dopamine-driven productivity planner** designed specifically for users with ADHD. It focuses on overcoming executive dysfunction, time blindness, and task initiation paralysis through gamification and low-friction interactions.

## 🚀 Key Features (Phase 1)

- **Quest Management:** Anti-shame, low-friction task creation and management.
- **Focus Mode:** Pomodoro-style timer ("Mana") with time-blindness defense.
- **Dopamine Driven:** Heavy use of animations and haptics for rewards.
- **Local-First:** Pure Sembast (offline-first) reliability.
- **Multi-Platform:** Built with Flutter for a consistent experience.
- **Smart Sync:** Switchable cloud backup via Firestore (optional).

## 📐 Design & Architecture

The project follows a local-first architecture where the local database (Sembast) is the single source of truth.
